;
; Example of copy-on-write into overlay AtomSpaces.
;
; The goal is to demonstrate how to use read-write atomspaces
; layered on top of a read-only atomspace.
;
; This creates two atomspaces: the base atomspace, which
; will be marked read-only (after adding atoms to it),
; and an overlay atomspace, which will remain read-write.
; Atoms and truth values can be manipulated in the overlay,
; without damaging atoms in the base space.
;
; The expected use case is a very-large read-only database
; holding data that is shared by many people. Individual users
; can then "mount" this database, and make local changes to it
; (i.e. perform read-write operations) without corrupting the
; shared read-only database.
;

; Create atoms in the base atomspace.
(define a (Concept "a"))
(define b (Concept "b"))

(cog-set-tv! a (cog-new-stv 0.1 0.1))

; Mark the current atomspace as read-only.
; New atoms can no longer be created.

; Truth values can no longer be changed.
(cog-set-tv! a (cog-new-stv 0.2 0.2))
(cog-prt-atomspace)
; Create an overlay (that will be read-write)
;
(define base (cog-atomspace))
(define ovly (cog-new-atomspace base))
(cog-set-atomspace! ovly)

; Alter the TV on atom a -- this causes a copy-on-write (COW)
; into the overlay atomspace.
(cog-set-tv! a (cog-new-stv 0.3 0.3))
(cog-prt-atomspace)
(cog-set-tv! a (cog-new-stv 0.4 0.4))
(cog-prt-atomspace)

; But in the base atomspace, we still have the original.
(cog-set-atomspace! base)
(cog-prt-atomspace)

; And the overlay still contains the modified atom.
(cog-set-atomspace! ovly)
(cog-prt-atomspace)

; Verify Links in the overlay
(OrderedLink a b)  ; note that a is in the base
(define averly (Concept "a")) ; get the overlay version
(ListLink averly b)
